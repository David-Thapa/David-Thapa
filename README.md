## Hi, I'm David 👋👨‍💻

Hi, I am David. I am Self Independent learner and Hardworking Individual. I Love tech stuff and usually hangout with tech nerds. Starting my Journey in IT, I had a huge learning process. Going through C programming language to C++, I had to search high and low for what I loved to do. Learning C#, Flutter, .net, Java script, HTML did not satisfied my hunger. But As I go to hard nerdy stuff I came in contact with python, and that broaden my horizon of thinking. Now, I am pursuing Machine Learning Engineer Career and Looking for a great opportunity in an impactful organization where I can contribute towards upcoming technology innovations ,so that I can broaden my scope of learning.
